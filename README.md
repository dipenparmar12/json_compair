# JSON Compare Tool

A browser-based tool for comparing and formatting JSON data. This tool allows you to:

- Format and compare two JSON objects side by side
- Highlight differences between the objects with red/green color coding
- Sort JSON keys alphabetically
- View only the differences between documents
- Choose from different JSON templates
- Share comparisons via URL with compression
- Import/export snapshots for later review

## Features

- **Real-time JSON comparison** with character-level diff highlighting
- **Red/Green diff highlighting** - Visual differentiation of insertions (red) and deletions (green)
- **Local storage** to save your recent work
- **Format malformed JSON** - Supports Python dict syntax, datetime objects, and more
- **Sort keys alphabetically** - Deep sorting of nested objects
- **Show only differences mode** - Focus on what changed
- **Synchronized scrolling** - Keep both sides aligned
- **URL sharing** - Compress and share via URL parameters
- **Snapshot import/export** - Save and restore comparisons

## CSV Support

- Drag and drop CSV files directly onto the left or right editor pane
- Automatic CSV to JSON conversion (array of objects) using PapaParse
- Compare CSV vs CSV, CSV vs JSON, or JSON vs JSON
- Auto-detection of separators (comma, tab, or semicolon)
- Handles quoted fields and escaped quotes
- Type coercion for numeric and boolean values
