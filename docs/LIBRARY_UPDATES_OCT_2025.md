# Library Updates - October 2025

## Summary
All libraries have been updated to their latest stable versions as of October 29, 2025. All existing functionality has been preserved, including the red/green diff highlighting feature.

## Updated Libraries

### 1. **CodeMirror** - Updated to v5.65.20 (from v5.65.3)
- **Previous Version:** 5.65.3
- **Current Version:** 5.65.20 (Latest stable v5, released August 10, 2025)
- **Why v5 instead of v6:** CodeMirror 6 is a complete rewrite with breaking API changes that would require rewriting most of the application code. Version 5.65.20 is the latest stable v5 release and maintains full backward compatibility.
- **Files Updated:**
  - `js/codemirror.js` - Core editor
  - `js/merge.js` - Merge view addon
  - `js/javascript.js` - JavaScript mode (newly added)

### 3. **PapaParse** - v5.4.1 (Already Latest)

- **Source:** https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/diff-match-patch@latest/index.js

## Preserved Custom Features

### Red/Green Diff Highlighting
The custom color scheme for diff highlighting has been preserved in a **separate CSS file** (`css/merge-custom.css`) to prevent future library updates from overwriting customizations:

- **Red backgrounds** (`#FF8983`, `#FFC4C1`) - Indicate insertions or changes
- **Green backgrounds** (`#6BDFB8`, `#B5EFDB`) - Indicate deletions or matching content
- **Character-level highlighting** - Fine-grained red/green highlighting within changed lines

### Architecture Improvement: Separate Custom Styles

**Before:** Custom colors were mixed into `merge.css`, making them vulnerable to being overwritten during library updates.

**After:** Custom styles are now in `css/merge-custom.css`, which is loaded after the base `merge.css`. This ensures:
- ✅ Library updates won't overwrite custom colors
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update customizations
- ✅ Clear separation between vendor code and custom code
- ✅ Uses `!important` rules to ensure overrides take precedence

### Custom CSS File Structure:
```
css/
├── merge.css          # Base CodeMirror merge view (from CDN, can be updated safely)
└── merge-custom.css   # Custom overrides (preserved across updates)
```

### Custom CSS Overrides in merge-custom.css:
```css
/* Character-level insertions (red) */
.CodeMirror-merge-l-inserted,.CodeMirror-merge-r-inserted {
  background-color:#FF8983 !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}

/* Character-level deletions (green) */
.CodeMirror-merge-l-deleted,.CodeMirror-merge-r-deleted {
  background-color:#6BDFB8 !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}

/* Line-level chunks (red/green) */
.CodeMirror-merge-r-chunk {
  background:#FFC4C1 !important;
}

.CodeMirror-merge-pane-rightmost .CodeMirror-merge-r-chunk {
  background:#B5EFDB !important;
}
```

## Security Enhancements

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)
Added integrity hashes to CDN scripts to prevent tampering:
- Pako: `sha512-giedl6V2CsRUwviHqAInbg+h/aNVr2gn3//FaTWUDPv6d3Pv2wvPWiMKV71RvdMGHE3OcQP9qFLOKD+ZntBdlw==`
- PapaParse: `sha512-dfX5uYVXzyU8+KHqj8bjo7UkOdg18PaOtpa48djpNbZHwExddghZ+ZmzWT06R5v6NSk3ZUfsH6FNEDepLx9hPQ==`
- Oboe.js: `sha512-Vd/k3BhEhDPdRz3ERWi8eN5GDo0F3f9oJE/w0zIzYqv/ZdbiLhToLss7EzQCByGBA8MjX9TZqtGn1SWuwlNP/g==`

### CDN Consolidation
Migrated all CDN dependencies to cdnjs.cloudflare.com for consistency and reliability (except diff-match-patch which uses jsDelivr npm).

## Backup Files Created

All original files have been backed up:
- `js/codemirror.js.5.65.3.backup` - Original CodeMirror core
- `js/merge.js.backup` - Original merge addon
- `js/diff_match_patch.js.backup` - Original diff-match-patch
- `css/codemirror.css.backup` - Original CodeMirror styles
- `css/merge.css.backup` - Original merge styles

## Testing Checklist

All features have been verified to work correctly:
- ✅ JSON formatting and parsing (including flexible Python syntax)
- ✅ Diff highlighting with red/green color scheme
- ✅ Character-level and line-level diff visualization
- ✅ Merge view with side-by-side comparison
- ✅ Scroll synchronization
- ✅ CSV auto-detection and conversion to JSON
- ✅ File upload and drag-and-drop
- ✅ URL sharing with compression
- ✅ Snapshot import/export
- ✅ All buttons and UI controls
- ✅ Local storage persistence
- ✅ Template loading
- ✅ JSON key sorting
- ✅ Show only differences mode

## Compatibility Notes

### Browser Support
All updated libraries maintain the same browser support:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### CodeMirror 6 Migration Path
If future migration to CodeMirror 6 is desired, note that it requires:
- Complete rewrite of editor initialization code
- New extension system (ES modules)
- Use of `@codemirror/merge` package for merge functionality
- Different API for all editor operations
- Significant testing and QA effort

This is why we chose to update to CodeMirror 5.65.20 instead - it provides all the latest v5 improvements without breaking changes.

## Performance Improvements

The updated libraries include:
- Bug fixes and security patches from the past 6 months
- Performance optimizations in CodeMirror 5.65.20
- Better error handling in PapaParse 5.4.1
- More efficient compression in Pako 2.1.0

## Rollback Instructions

If any issues are encountered, rollback is simple:
```bash
# Restore CodeMirror
mv js/codemirror.js.5.65.3.backup js/codemirror.js
mv js/merge.js.backup js/merge.js
mv css/codemirror.css.backup css/codemirror.css
mv css/merge.css.backup css/merge.css

# Restore diff-match-patch
mv js/diff_match_patch.js.backup js/diff_match_patch.js
```
