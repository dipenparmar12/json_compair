## Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Text Editor**: CodeMirror 5.65.3 with merge view
- **Diff Engine**: Google's diff_match_patch library
- **Compression**: Pako 2.1.0 for gzip compression
- **CSV Processing**: Custom parser with PapaParse fallback
- **Storage**: localStorage with IndexedDB fallback

### Performance Characteristics
- **Small Files** (<1KB): Instant processing
- **Medium Files** (1-150KB): Synchronous processing, <1 second response
- **Large Files** (150KB-5MB): Web Worker processing, 1-10 second response
- **Memory Usage**: 2-3x file size during active comparison
- **Network**: CDN dependencies for enhanced features only

### Browser Support Matrix
- **Minimum Requirements**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13.1+, Edge 80+
- **Full Features**: Modern browsers with Web Workers, Clipboard API
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work without optional APIs
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with touch-optimized interface

## Deployment and Operations

### Hosting Requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Static file hosting (GitHub Pages, CDN, Apache, Nginx)
- **SSL**: HTTPS required for production use (modern browser APIs)
- **Dependencies**: No server-side processing or database requirements
- **Scalability**: Client-side processing scales with user devices

### Development Workflow
- **Local Testing**: `python3 -m http.server 8000` or equivalent
- **Version Control**: Git-based with GitHub Pages automatic deployment
- **No Build Process**: Direct file editing and browser testing
- **Library Updates**: Manual version pinning and compatibility testing

## Security and Privacy Model

### Data Privacy Guarantees
- **Local Processing**: All data remains in user's browser
- **No Server Transmission**: Content never sent to external servers
- **Optional Sharing**: URL sharing is user-initiated only
- **Storage Control**: Users control local data persistence

### Security Considerations
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and content escaping
- **Content Security**: Safe parsing of user-provided JSON/CSV data
- **Resource Loading**: Secure CDN integration with local fallbacks
- **URL Sharing**: Base64 encoding with compression (not encryption)

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility verification
- **Edge Case Testing**: Large files, malformed data, network failures
- **Performance Testing**: Memory usage, processing speed, UI responsiveness
- **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: All features work across supported browsers
- **Performance**: Sub-second response for typical use cases
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring no documentation
- **Reliability**: Graceful handling of errors and edge cases

## Future Roadmap Considerations

### Near-Term Enhancements (Low Effort)

- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced mobile gesture support
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Medium-Term Features (Moderate Effort)
- Plugin architecture for extensions
- Advanced diff algorithms
- Export to multiple formats
- Integration with external tools

### Long-Term Vision (High Effort)
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Advanced data transformation
- AI-powered semantic comparison
- Progressive Web App features
