Perfect! I've successfully implemented automatic URL cleaning after importing or loading content from URLs. Here's what was added:

## âœ… **URL Auto-Cleaning Implementation**

### **1. Added `clearURL()` Method to URLManager**
- Added a new method in utils.js to clear URL parameters and keep the URL clean
- Uses `window.history.replaceState()` to update the URL without parameters

### **2. URL Cleaning After Loading from URL Parameters**
- When the page loads with URL parameters (shared links), the content is loaded into editors
- **After successful loading**, the URL parameters are automatically cleared
- Keeps the URL clean for users who loaded shared content

### **3. URL Cleaning After Importing Snapshots**
- When users import a snapshot file (`.json.gz` or `.json`)
- **After successful import**, the URL parameters are automatically cleared  
- Prevents confusion with old URL parameters when working with imported content

### **4. Console Logging for Debugging**
- Added console logs to track when URL clearing occurs
- Helps with debugging and understanding the flow

## **How It Works:**

1. **Load Shared URL** â†’ Content loads â†’ URL automatically cleans itself
2. **Import Snapshot** â†’ Content loads â†’ URL automatically cleans itself  
3. **Manual Clearing** â†’ "Clear All" button already clears URL (existing functionality)
4. **Share New Content** â†’ Use "Copy Share URL" button (on-demand only)

## **Benefits:**

âœ… **Clean URLs** - No leftover parameters after loading content  
âœ… **Better UX** - Users get clean URLs after importing/loading  
âœ… **No Confusion** - Old URL parameters don't interfere with new content  
âœ… **Consistent Behavior** - URL cleaning happens automatically where it makes sense  

The application now automatically keeps URLs clean after importing content or loading from shared URLs, while still allowing on-demand URL generation when the "Copy Share URL" button is clicked! ðŸŽ‰

**Test it by:**
1. Opening a shared URL with parameters
2. Notice the URL cleans itself after loading
3. Import a snapshot file  
4. Notice the URL cleans itself after import
5. Use "Copy Share URL" to generate new shareable links on-demand
