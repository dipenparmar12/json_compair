## âœ… Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented your suggestion to move URL tracking from continuous to on-demand. Here's what was changed:

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Automatic URL Tracking** 
   - Eliminated the continuous `URLManager.saveToURL()` calls from the `saveContent` function
   - No more URL updates on every keystroke or content change
   - This prevents browser freezing with large datasets

2. **Enhanced "Copy Share URL" Button Logic**
   - Improved the button to handle both small and large content intelligently
   - Uses actual URL length (1800 chars) instead of fixed 50KB threshold
   - Better user feedback with loading states and status messages
   - Automatic fallback to file download for large content

3. **Cleaned Up Obsolete Code**
   - Removed `URL_SIZE_THRESHOLD` constant (50KB limit)
   - Removed `URL_UPDATE_DEBOUNCE` constant 
   - Eliminated all automatic URL update checks from import, drag-drop, and paste operations

### **How It Works Now:**

- **Small Content (< 1800 chars URL)**: Copies shareable URL directly to clipboard
- **Large Content (> 1800 chars URL)**: Automatically creates and downloads a compressed `.json.gz` file
- **No Continuous Tracking**: URL is only generated when the "Copy Share URL" button is clicked
- **Better Performance**: No more freezing with large datasets during editing

### **Benefits:**

âœ… **No more freezing** with large datasets  
âœ… **On-demand URL generation** only when needed  
âœ… **Automatic file download** fallback for large content  
âœ… **Better user experience** with loading states and clear feedback  
âœ… **Cleaner code** with removed obsolete URL tracking logic  

The application is now running successfully on `http://localhost:8000` and ready for testing with both small and large datasets! ðŸŽ‰
